# Glossary

The words this codebase uses for the things it models, and what each one means here
specifically. When a term has a general meaning in the industry and a narrower one in this
project, the narrower one wins — that is what this file is for.

Terms are grouped by the area of the application they belong to. Add a term when its
meaning is not obvious from the code, or when two people have already used it to mean two
different things.

## Session and authentication

Introduced by [ADR 0008](adr/0008-a-sealed-session-on-the-new-api.md), which records why the
model looks like this.

**Session**
: What the application knows about the person making a request: their identity, the tokens
that authenticate them, and when the access token expires. It lives in two cookies written
together — a sealed, http-only one holding all of it, and a readable companion holding the
access token alone. "The session" means the whole of that, and reading it always means
reading the sealed cookie; the readable cookie is only ever a copy of one field.

**Access token**
: The short-lived credential sent to the API as a bearer token to prove who the caller is.
It carries the identity in its own claims, which is where the session gets the account's id,
email, account type and roles rather than asking an endpoint for them. It is the one part of
the session a page script can read, because client code needs it to call the API directly.

**Refresh token**
: The long-lived credential that buys a new access token when the current one expires. It
never leaves the sealed cookie, and it **rotates** — spending it yields a new refresh token
and invalidates the old one. That rotation is why two requests renewing at the same time can
sign a user out; see the ADR's consequences.

**Renewal**
: Exchanging an expired access token for a fresh pair. It happens in the middleware, before
the request is served, so that a token expiring in the background never surfaces to the
person using the site. A renewal that fails clears the session and the request continues as
anonymous — it does not redirect, because a middleware redirect is not followed for a server
action.

**Protected route**
: A path only an authenticated account may open. An anonymous visitor on one is sent to the
login route with their original destination preserved, so signing in returns them to where
they were going. The member area is protected by prefix; checkout and its outcomes are
listed explicitly.

**Auth route**
: A path that exists to authenticate — login and the sign-up screens. The mirror of a
protected route: an _authenticated_ visitor on one is sent to their dashboard, because a
form for something already done is not worth showing.

**Guest**
: An account type the session carries and the guards refuse, treating it as anonymous on a
protected route. No guest session is ever created by this application. The type is honoured
because the API can issue one, not because anything here produces one.
